# AngularWeatherElement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## How to use ?

Clone this project

To install packages run command : npm install

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

I have added one more HTML file in the project named as 'weather.html' in which I have called the custom angular element.
For this to work, you need to copy 'ng-city-weather.js' file from elements folder from angular project which is at source level.
Place ng-city-weather.js, weather.html file at same level and run the HTML file in browser. You will see the output.
